>Ok, `MSGCLASS` and `CLASS` are pretty easy.  `A` is for the printer 1.  `Z` is usually Printer 2.  `H` is Hold in the Outlist.  `Z` is basically the same thing.  I have my `MSGCLASS Z` pointing at Printer2 as well.  The printer output is found (for most people) on your linux machine in the OS folder (on my machine it's /home/mainframe) in the prt directory, or /home/mainframe/prt.  Printer 1 is printer00e.txt, printer2 is printer00f.txt.

>I'm learning this mess too LOL.  I have to say though, if you like to write code, by far the most fun you'll have is with BREXX.  That lets you write code that interacts with the terminal, or what in the mainframe world is called transactional.  The way you're doing it with cobol is called batch processing or running it all at once and then literally forgetting it.

>The terms get in the way sometimes, like the Catalog and VTOC.  Catalog is just a database of files, (files can be uncataloged too) and the VTOC is the Volume Table of Contents (or directory).  BREXX is the same as REXX and runs here, as well as under linux, OS2 etc.  Learn it here, and you'll know it there although the MVS version has features linux doesn't and linux has features MVS doesn't because of the differences in the operating system and how terminals are handled.
